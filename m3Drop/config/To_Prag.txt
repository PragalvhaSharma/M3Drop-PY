Hello Prag,

Here are the instructions:
  1.  From this point on, we are going to use coreGPU.py, diagnosticsGPU.py, and normalizationGPU.py as the main source code. Don't worry about the other codes.
      I have blocked out the entire NB_UMI.py so there's no conflict with any function names.
  2.  Your task is as follows:
      a.  All the functions in coreGPU.py, core_pipelineGPU.py, diagnosticsGPU.py, diagnostics_pipelineGPU.py, normalizationGPU.py, and normalization_pipelineGPU.py must be converted into a CPU compatible/exclusive format.
          GPU functions will handle the normal pipelines involving GPUs, so you only need to focus on getting the codes run on only CPU.
      b.  The goal is to give the users an option to choose if they wish to run the pipelines on a CPU or a GPU. Consequently, I have changed the names of the functions to function_nameGPU to indicate GPU.
          I would like to ask you to do the same but with CPU (for example, ConvertDataSparseCPU)
      c.  Once successfully completed, we should have 6 additional files: coreCPU.py, core_pipelineCPU.py, and so on. When this is done, you may package this and let me know, I will begin the testing.
      d.  Once the testing is complete, it'll be up to me to re-write the tutorials, I'll get this done asap this time :)
  3.  NOTE: Download the biggest human data (at least 20gb) from cellxgene and test it on your hardware. Our selling point is scalability. 

Let me know if you have any questions.
